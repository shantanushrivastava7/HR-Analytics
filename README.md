📊 Project: HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
🔍 Problem Statement
A company is experiencing increasing employee attrition and wants to understand the key drivers behind it. The goal is to analyze HR data to identify patterns in employee turnover and provide actionable insights to improve retention.

📈 Key Insights & Findings
High Attrition Rate in Certain Departments

The Sales and Human Resources departments showed the highest attrition rates, especially among employees with fewer than 3 years of experience.

Job Role and Satisfaction Impact Turnover

Employees with low Job Satisfaction and Work-Life Balance scores were 2x more likely to leave.

Roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive had higher turnover.

Years at Company vs Attrition

Attrition is highest among employees with 0–2 years at the company.

Long-tenured employees (>5 years) showed higher loyalty and lower attrition.

Education and Attrition Not Strongly Correlated

Surprisingly, educational level didn’t have a significant impact on attrition, indicating that workplace conditions may play a larger role.

Age Group 25–35 Most Likely to Leave

Younger employees were more likely to resign, possibly in search of growth opportunities or better compensation.

Overtime and Attrition Strongly Linked

A very high percentage of employees who did overtime eventually left, signaling a need to address workload or burnout.
